//
//	Updater.h
//
//	Drives the plug-in's self-update using NATIVE Vectorworks dialogs
//	(gSDK->AlertInform / gSDK->AlertQuestion). The network + install mechanics
//	are delegated to the vw-update.sh script bundled inside the .vwlibrary (it
//	runs non-interactively and prints machine-readable output; see its q-stable
//	/ q-dev / do-install modes), while every user-facing dialog is shown by the
//	plug-in itself. So nobody has to open a terminal.
//
//	  * The STABLE plug-in checks for a newer build at Vectorworks start-up:
//	    RunStableStartupCheck() — silent when already current, otherwise asks
//	    (native yes/no) whether to install.
//	  * The DEV plug-in lets the user pick which branch's build to use, also at
//	    Vectorworks start-up: RunDevStartupCheck() — installs the chosen build
//	    only if it differs from the one already installed. Doing this at start-up
//	    (rather than each time the command runs) matters because a plug-in may
//	    re-invoke its own command programmatically, and the build in use can only
//	    change at start-up anyway — so the picker belongs where the build is
//	    actually loaded, not on every command run.
